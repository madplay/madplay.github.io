# LINE Plus SW Development Interview Review

The self-introduction letter was similar to other IT companies. A slightly unique self-introduction letter item was introducing 'the major subject you were most interested in taking (reading)' 
or major books, which was a question style I saw for the first time. It made me look back on my college life again...


After passing the document screening, I went to LINE Plus headquarters at Seohyeon Station for the interview.
I have a habit (?) of going to places a bit early when there are interviews or appointments and drinking coffee,
so I was waiting at Starbucks in front of headquarters for the interview time to approach...

After time passed and I entered the headquarters building, I received a name tag at the LINE Plus office entrance, received guidance, and entered the interview room.
The **difficulty level was above average**. It proceeded with one applicant and two interviewers.

Basic computer science knowledge was fundamental, and there were many parts asking about practical development knowledge and points on how to solve things even if you don't know answers to questions.
In the case of computer science knowledge, there were many parts similar to what I studied while operating a blog, so there wasn't much burden, but in questions asking about creativity,
I think I struggled quite a bit.

Also, there was a part of doing simple coding on a whiteboard, and actually, the code was very easy!
But I think I didn't grasp the point of the question the interviewer wanted to get during the process of writing that code.
(When I got home, I thought about it. Ah! Could that be why they asked that question?)

Every time I take interviews, I feel that **even things I know don't come to mind when facing interviewers.**
Especially, there are cases where I can't solve even really easy content because I panic.

I think the ability to overcome such tension and solve problems is important. It seems they need people with such abilities.
It was an interview that helped me a lot in various ways.
