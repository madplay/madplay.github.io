# Software Maestro Interview Review

For the document screening, you needed to introduce projects you had worked on centered on the self-introduction letter.
So you submit a portfolio, and I saw cases where people passed even without one, but I think having one increases the probability.

After passing the document screening, 'in-depth interviews' including group discussion evaluation and coding tests were conducted.
It seems the process changes a bit each year. In the previous recruitment, I think they conducted personality tests and in-depth interviews.

Group discussion evaluation is where 6~8 people form a team and proceed with discussion on a specific topic. You appeal your opinions about given topics and
finally, all team members need to reach an agreement. Personally, I think the main evaluation elements are your thoughts on problems and
how you appeal those thoughts to others rather than finding correct answers.

On the other hand, since you must finally agree with all team members and select one opinion,
it also seems to evaluate cooperation and what appearance you show within specific groups.
During the evaluation, you could also see judges evaluating in the middle.

After group discussion evaluation ended, coding tests and in-depth interviews were conducted about 1 week later.

In the case of coding tests, if you frequently looked at algorithm problem sites, you could have solved them quickly.
I couldn't solve them all. They were difficult.

After coding tests ended, in-depth interviews were conducted with the source code you wrote.
I couldn't completely transfer the algorithm for solving given problems into code... but since I could conceive it, I think I explained
the algorithm through the interview.

So definitely! Even if you can't solve all problems, don't be discouraged and try explaining the algorithm.
After code review ends, personality questions and technical interviews are conducted, and portfolio content seemed to take up about half,
and the rest were technical parts. It was quite difficult.
