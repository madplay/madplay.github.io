# Com2us Platform Development Interview Review

There was no length limit for the self-introduction letter, so I think I wrote it really freely and excitedly.
And as expected of an IT company, I submitted a personal portfolio. I wrote and submitted works I had participated in competitions.

I think I didn't receive notice that there was a written exam... The interview process included a written exam.
Both the written exam and interview process took about 2 hours total.

The written exam questions were more diverse than expected. But fortunately, there were quite a few things I had written in my blog while studying during my student days.
New graduate processes seem to evaluate a lot about basic but important fundamental qualities.

There were also database-related problems, and they were quite complex. There were things like writing simple queries and analyzing based on performance.
Operating system-related content was also tested. I think it would have been okay if you had studied a bit for the information processing engineer exam.

In the case of interviews, they seemed to proceed really comfortably and freely, like the company's atmosphere.
The atmosphere was really good. It proceeded with four interviewers and four interview applicants,
and everyone had opportunities to speak freely (most are like that), and everyone seemed to proceed with the interview while laughing.

Self-introduction was basic, and there were questions about introducing projects in the portfolio you submitted, why you applied to Com2us,
and what position you would like to take if hired.
Of course, questions about major knowledge were basic. They seemed to talk while looking at written exam results.

I felt that the interviewers helped applicants a lot to comfortably take the interview.
Especially, I was really impressed by the HR person coming out to meet us even to the elevator.

After finishing, they also gave interview expenses. Great!
