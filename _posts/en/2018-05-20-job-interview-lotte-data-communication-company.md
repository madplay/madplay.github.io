# Lotte Data Communication Company Spectacle Audition

No-spec hiring. I remember it as a process that was a hot topic at the time. (Trying to remember...)

Since I majored in Computer Engineering, I applied to Lotte Data Communication Company. Application is simple.
If you write your portfolio in the given form, the document screening is done.
These days, most ask you to attach portfolios, but in this process, portfolio attachment was mandatory.

There's **no self-introduction letter either**. There's also no writing of language-related specs like TOEIC, OPIc.<br/>
It's really no-spec hiring that evaluates only by ability, as the name suggests. Right?

For portfolios, you just need to write brief introductions of projects you worked on, parts you directly implemented,
difficulties or achievements from projects, etc. Personally, for projects without award records in the achievement part,
I think I wrote what knowledge I learned and what experience I gained through this project.

A few days after document screening results were announced, the audition (?) was conducted.

Since it was a process implemented almost for the first time, there wasn't much information, but in emails received a few days later,
related topics were given and detailed schedules were announced.

<div class="post_caption">From 9 AM to 6 PM, with 'Web Programming' as the assignment topic,<br/>
you need to design (DB, modules) and implement the project you will develop.</div>

When I arrived on the audition day, there were a total of 21 people who passed the document screening. I remember some of them didn't attend.
I was surprised because fewer were selected than expected.

The topic 'Web Programming' was presented in advance, but more detailed topics were announced on the day.
The problem was really well understood but... from the perspective of that time when I had no web development experience, it was quite difficult.

Honestly, I think I was too ignorant at that time.

It proceeds full-time for 9 hours, but there are break times in between, and lunch time too.

From 9 AM to 12 PM, after designing modules, databases, and overall system structure, represent them as structure diagrams
(they give you paper and you draw structure diagrams on it.)

From 12 PM to 1 PM, lunch was provided. Also at the company cafeteria!
And after a brief rest, (there was also smoking time for smokers. Of course, with employee accompaniment)
development proceeded from 2 PM based on content designed in the morning.

When the audition ends, you submit source code and design diagrams and receive interview expenses, and that's it.<br/>
And the very next day, technical & personality interviews were conducted based on implemented content.

Unfortunately, I couldn't participate in the final interview due to personal circumstances.
Good luck to those applying to Lotte Spectacle Audition next time!
