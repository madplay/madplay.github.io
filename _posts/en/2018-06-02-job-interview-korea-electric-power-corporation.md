# Korea Electric Power Corporation IT Information & Communication Interview Review

The character limit for the self-introduction letter was 400 characters. It seemed harder than writing long ones.
When writing, I thought 1,000 characters was good because you could include a lot of content...
When the maximum character limit is small, it's difficult because you have to condense and write only essential content.

The interview location was conducted in the northern Gyeonggi region I applied for, and it proceeded with three interviewers and four applicants.
One of the interview applicants became the representative among those taking the interview together and 'greeted at the start and end of the interview'.
We all just greeted together matching timing. (I became the representative...)

The difficulty of questions wasn't very high, but I think it was good to speak your thoughts honestly.
Each of the three interviewers seemed to have very different styles. Especially, age groups seemed very different too.

They asked not only technical content but also questions related to character.
For example, the most difficult experience or good experience, or whether you jaywalk at places where no one is watching, etc.?
They also asked about company-related content.

After finishing, they gave 50,000 won for interview expenses.
There were workplaces by each region, so it looked really good.
