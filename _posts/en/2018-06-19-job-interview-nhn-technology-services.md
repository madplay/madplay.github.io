# NHN Technology Services Written Test Review

The document screening was also not much different in format from other IT companies.
Actually, what can I say. I feel like you gradually gain know-how as you keep experiencing document screenings or interview processes.

The written test was conducted at the 16th floor training room of Green Factory, Naver headquarters building located in Jeongja-dong, Bundang-gu.
The company name contains NHN, and it might be confused with NHN Entertainment, which is now separated... but it's a Naver affiliate!

Pre-Test was conducted for a total of 90 minutes. It seems several teams take it per day.
I took it from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM. There were a total of 11 problems.

Java language problems were presented, and there were also types of problems where only method names were given and you filled in detailed content.
Parts that were really difficult, things you couldn't learn in undergraduate courses, seemed fewer than expected.

Moreover, while it was a principle to write answers in Java language, there was a notice that you could write the language you wrote above each problem's answer
and that you could also write in C or C++ languages.

Problems were diverse, like differences in String declaration and comparison methods, comparing complexity or logic when specific algorithms were given,
methods for quickly searching for existence of specific words within strings, etc.

I heard they recently changed the company name to N Tech Service.
