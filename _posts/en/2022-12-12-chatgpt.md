# ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a conversational AI chatbot that OpenAI released in early December 2022. It is similar to
<a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a> in that it can suggest program code,
but one key difference is that ChatGPT also answers everyday questions in a conversational format.

The example below shows this more clearly.

# Can It Also Write Code?
A more surprising point is that it solves algorithm problems. If you copy the problem statement of LeetCode problem #2,
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Add Two Numbers</a>, and ask ChatGPT, it generates code as shown below.
For reference, this problem is Medium difficulty.

I submitted the code from ChatGPT as-is, and the result was Accepted.

The result is not the most efficient implementation in speed or memory usage, but it is not poor on average either.

# Then...
ChatGPT clearly looks different from earlier AI programs. In particular, it is striking that the conversation continues naturally as shown below.

For reference, like Github Copilot, ChatGPT also works from existing documents. So it cannot provide correct answers for content that is not yet collected.
(According to related articles, it seems to miss some information after 2021.)

As I used it more, I kept thinking, "It still has clear limits." That also applies to the question in this post title,
"Can AI replace developers?" Personally, the answer is still unclear.

At minimum, developers do more than write code. They also review creative ways to solve problems. A simple example is how we modify code while carefully avoiding impact on existing behavior.
In addition, AI does not understand code quality, which increases the risk of embedding latent problems in the implementation.
In this context, do not overtrust code suggested by ChatGPT.

# Closing
So far, this post reviewed ChatGPT. It has technical limitations, but it is clearly a new AI that creates major debates in many areas.
Even at the moment of writing, it keeps learning from a large volume of documents.

> One month later, in January 2023, the ChatGPT wave put big tech companies such as Google and Microsoft on alert.
> AI competition appears to intensify.
