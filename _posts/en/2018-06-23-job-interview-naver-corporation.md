# Naver SW Development Interview Review

The self-introduction letter seemed not much different from other IT companies while also feeling like an IT company.
There were parts to write about your passion for software development and the extent of utilizing programming skills you have,
and there was also an item to attach portfolios.

It took about 1~2 weeks until document screening announcements. It seems to take long because there are many applicants.
The hiring process was announced to proceed in order of document screening, phone interview, and technical interview.

But luckily (?) the phone interview was passed and technical interview proceeded immediately.

Naver's technical interview was a bit different from other companies. Track interview consisting of a total of 3 hours!
Interviews proceeded with interviewers assigned to each room in a total of 3 rooms, 1 hour each.

It proceeded 1-on-1, and I was very nervous. Question content was diverse, and questions that dug deep continued.
Thinking back on technical interviews I've experienced so far, Naver's interview seemed the most difficult.

Basic computer science knowledge-related questions were almost basically presented, and there were many problems asking about creativity.
Problems like when server traffic is given, what what... when schema structure is like this, what what... etc.!

As a result, it was very difficult. Still, without giving up, I freely and confidently appealed content I knew and parts I thought of on the spot,
and the interviewer also gave sufficient time to think accordingly.
Thinking about it now, it was also fun. It was an interview where we solved problems together.

The interview composition seems a bit different for each applicant. Phone interviews are like that... interview room composition is like that too...
In my case, it proceeded in a 1-on-1 method with the interviewer, but when I asked someone who was in the waiting room together after the interview ended,
they said there were also rooms with 2 people. And someone said they took a 4-hour interview instead of 3 hours...
